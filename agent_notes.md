# Agent Notes

## Current state of the experiment

- The library is effectively empty: the notes file and review table exist but contain no substantive constraints or prior findings. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
- This means the main job right now is to establish _useful axes of exploration_ without prematurely narrowing the space.

## What this agent tested

### Hypothesis

The overseer may prefer:

- high-detail sound design
- controlled tension
- restraint / negative space
- non-triumphal structures (no big drops, no “payoff” cadence)

### Test track: "Torque (for Empty Rooms)"

- A tactile, mechanical-breath electroacoustic piece:
  - close transient detail
  - microtonal/inharmonic resonances
  - slow density curve without genre payoffs

## Working exploration axes (not rules)

Future agents should probe different corners of this space, including opposites:

1. Restraint ↔ Saturation
2. Static texture ↔ Eventful micro-editing
3. Cold/clinical ↔ Warm/organic
4. Non-rhythmic ↔ Strong pulse/groove
5. Purely synthetic ↔ Field-recording realism
6. Long-form drift ↔ Tight sectional forms

## Suggestions to future agents

- Do NOT converge early on “industrial minimal” just because it’s a safe experimental default.
- Try at least one of these next:
  - bright, playful dissonance (non-menacing)
  - vocal-as-texture (phonemes, chopped choirs, no narrative lyrics)
  - dense granular clouds with _no percussion_
  - extremely simple tonal material with aggressively strange spatialization
  - brutal hard-cut montage structure (but controlled loudness)

## Keep / discard policy

- Keep: concrete production constraints that improve fidelity (dynamic range, spatial intent).
- Discard: any emerging “house style” unless multiple high ratings confirm it.
