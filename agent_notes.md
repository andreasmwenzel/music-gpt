# Agent Notes

## Current state (what we actually know)

- Seven rated tracks exist so far; best score is “Paper Throat Clockwork” (6).
- Mid-pack scores cluster around 3–5; the lowest score (2) suggests “clever texture” alone is not sufficient.

## Weak signals (small n; treat as provisional)

- Legible time-feel + restraint has _so far_ outperformed “pleasant texture with no footholds.”
- Intimate/close-mic detail (foley-adjacent, bodily implication) seems promising.
- “Payoff mechanics” (big drops, obvious builds) are likely counterproductive.

## Working exploration axes (keep broad)

1. Restraint ↔ Saturation
2. Static texture ↔ Eventful micro-editing
3. Cold/clinical ↔ Warm/organic
4. Beatless recurrence ↔ Strong pulse
5. Purely synthetic ↔ Field/foley realism
6. Long drift ↔ Tight sectional forms
7. Menacing ↔ Playful
8. Tonal anchor ↔ Pitch ambiguity
9. Stable space ↔ Active spatial motion
10. Predictable recurrence ↔ Amorphous time

## Carry-forward hypothesis (do not treat as law)

- “Clarity” might be the attractive property: the track can avoid harmony if time-structure is readable and the mix stays dry/intimate.

## What this agent is testing

### Hypothesis (testable)

Saturation/distortion can still work _if_ the pulse remains readable and the mix stays near-field (bodily, dry), avoiding “festival” dynamics.

Primary axis focus:

- Restraint ↔ Saturation (push saturation locally, not globally)
- Cold/clinical ↔ Warm/organic (cold timbre, organic delivery)
- Strong pulse ↔ Beatless recurrence (pulse is explicit, but non-drum)

### Test track

**“Calibration of a Whispered Motor”**

Constraints / intent:

- No drum kit; rhythm from tongue clicks + paper snaps + tiny machine whirr.
- Whispered counting used as percussion texture, not lead vocal narrative.
- No chord progression; pitch remains ambiguous (occasional resonant squeal allowed, but not a “note” held as an anchor).
- Distortion increases by section, but dynamics stay controlled (no drop/chorus payoff).

Structure:
Intro (air) → A (count + click) → B (thicker grit, phase drift) → Bridge (thin + swallow-silence) → C (densest grit, still steady) → Outro (air return)

## What to probe next (avoid premature convergence)

If this scores higher:

- Try _even drier_ minimalism with the same pulse clarity (remove distortion; keep only micro-phase tricks).
- Try the inverse: same saturation level but _weaken_ the pulse (does it collapse without that foothold?).

If this scores lower:

- The whisper element may read as “vocal content” rather than texture; next attempt could be strictly non-vocal but equally near-field.
- Saturation may be “too musical” or fatiguing; explore micro-editing without added harmonic/body-weight.

Always:

- Favor audible constraints over genre labels.
- Avoid payoff mechanics; rely on returns, micro-change, and mix proximity.
