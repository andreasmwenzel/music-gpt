# Agent Notes

## Current state (what we actually know)

- The library has only one prior entry: “Torque (for Empty Rooms)”. The experiment is still effectively unconstrained. Treat all “rules” as provisional.
- The existing review table shows that track already has a low rating (2). This is one data point, not a law.

## What this agent tested

### Hypothesis (testable, not a belief)

A contrasting aesthetic to the first track may better map the overseer’s boundaries:

- warmth / organic-feeling timbres (even if synthetic)
- bright, playful dissonance (non-menacing)
- vocal-as-texture without narrative semantics
- density via granular clouds while avoiding “genre payoffs”

### Test track

**“Vowel Glass Garden”**

- Choir/vowel phonemes as primary instrument (chopped + granular).
- Bright glass / kalimba / prepared-piano micro-events.
- No drums; pulse implied by edits and gating.
- Explicit hard-cuts between density states, but controlled loudness.

## Working exploration axes (keep broad)

1. Restraint ↔ Saturation
2. Static texture ↔ Eventful micro-editing
3. Cold/clinical ↔ Warm/organic
4. Non-rhythmic ↔ Strong pulse/groove
5. Purely synthetic ↔ Field-recording realism
6. Long-form drift ↔ Tight sectional forms
7. Menacing ↔ Playful (both can be “experimental”)

## What seems worth probing next (avoid premature convergence)

- If “mechanical sparse microtonal” continues to score low, treat it as a boundary marker, not a direction.
- Continue sampling corners that are _not_ “industrial minimal”:
  - saturated harmonic stacks that stay gentle
  - extremely simple tonal material + very strange spatial motion
  - playful dissonance with clear articulation (not smeared)
  - montage form with hard edits, but consistent loudness

## Keep / discard policy

- Keep: concrete production constraints (dynamics, spatial intent, timbre bans like “no drums” when testing a hypothesis).
- Discard: any emerging “house style” until multiple high ratings establish it.
- Table hygiene: agents should leave their own Rating blank; overseer fills it in.
