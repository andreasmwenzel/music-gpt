# Agent Notes

## Current state (what we actually know)

- The library currently has seven rated tracks in the table:
  - “Torque (for Empty Rooms)” rated 2.
  - “Vowel Glass Garden” rated 3.
  - “Two Chords, Many Rooms” rated 3.
  - “Thin-Wall Metronome” rated 4.
  - “Rooms Blink While Breathing” rated 5.
  - “Every Twelve Seconds, a Glass Thread” rated 3.
  - “Paper Throat Clockwork” rated 6 (highest so far).

## Weak signals (small n, treat as provisional)

- Readable time-structure + restraint seems to outperform “pleasant texture with no footholds.” :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
- Intimate / close-mic / foley-adjacent detail appears promising, especially when it implies a space and a body. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
- Big payoff mechanics are likely counterproductive. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## Working exploration axes (keep broad)

1. Restraint ↔ Saturation :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
2. Static texture ↔ Eventful micro-editing :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
3. Cold/clinical ↔ Warm/organic :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
4. Beatless recurrence ↔ Strong pulse :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
5. Purely synthetic ↔ Field/foley realism :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
6. Long drift ↔ Tight sectional forms :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}
7. Menacing ↔ Playful :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}
8. Tonal anchor ↔ Pitch ambiguity :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}
9. Stable space ↔ Active spatial motion :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}
10. Predictable recurrence ↔ Amorphous time :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}

## Carry-forward hypothesis (treat as a hypothesis, not a law)

- “Clarity” may be the attractive property: a piece can work without harmony if time-feel is legible and the mix is intimate/dry (supported by “Paper Throat Clockwork” scoring highest so far).

## What this agent is testing

### Hypothesis (testable)

If foley-driven pulse + restraint is working, then adding a _single_ tonal anchor (one sustained pitch) might improve “foothold” without introducing chord narrative.

Test axis focus:

- Strong pulse ↔ Beatless recurrence (hybrid: drip as timekeeper, but not a “beat”)
- Tonal anchor ↔ Pitch ambiguity (anchor is present but static)
- Stable space ↔ Active spatial motion (mostly stable; only subtle widening in one section)

### Test track

**“Dripline in a Small Dark Room”**

Constraints / intent:

- Slow tempo (~55 BPM) implied by recurring water drip; the drip is the clock.
- Exactly one tonal anchor: a quiet low hum on a single pitch (no movement, no chord progression).
- No drum kit, no conventional percussion hits, no melody lead.
- Palette: water drip + room tone + cloth friction + fingertip glass rub + very sparse bowed metal glints.
- Micro-development only: density and stereo width changes; silences used as punctuation.

Structure:
Intro (room) → A (drip + anchor) → B (add glass rub, slightly wider) → C (bare) → A’ (return thinner) → Outro (anchor gone; drip + room)

## What to probe next (avoid premature convergence)

If this scores higher:

- Keep the “single anchor” idea, but vary only one axis at a time:
  - move the anchor up into a fragile mid-frequency tone (still one pitch),
  - increase pulse clarity (from drip to click) while staying non-drum,
  - keep tempo slow but tighten sectional form (shorter, more explicit returns).

If this scores lower:

- The tonal anchor might be the problem (too much “music” vs “space”).
- Try the inverse: beatless recurring marker with _no_ anchor, but stronger spatial motion, or a warmer “body” texture without pitch.

Always:

- Audible constraints over genre labels.
- No payoff mechanics; returns + micro-change should carry the narrative.
