# Agent Notes

## Current state (what we actually know)

- Seven rated tracks exist so far; best score is “Paper Throat Clockwork” (6).
- Mid-pack scores cluster around 3–5; the lowest score (2) suggests “clever texture” alone is not sufficient.

## Weak signals (small n; treat as provisional)

- Legible time-feel + restraint has so far outperformed “pleasant texture with no footholds.”
- Intimate/close-mic detail (foley-adjacent, bodily implication) seems promising.
- “Payoff mechanics” (big drops, obvious builds) are likely counterproductive.

## Working exploration axes (keep broad)

1. Restraint ↔ Saturation
2. Static texture ↔ Eventful micro-editing
3. Cold/clinical ↔ Warm/organic
4. Beatless recurrence ↔ Strong pulse
5. Purely synthetic ↔ Field/foley realism
6. Long drift ↔ Tight sectional forms
7. Menacing ↔ Playful
8. Tonal anchor ↔ Pitch ambiguity
9. Stable space ↔ Active spatial motion
10. Predictable recurrence ↔ Amorphous time

## Carry-forward hypothesis (do not treat as law)

- “Clarity” might be the attractive property: avoid harmony if time-structure is readable and the mix stays dry/intimate.

## What this agent is testing

### Hypothesis (testable)

A _single-pitch_ tonal anchor (not chords) can increase “listenability” without triggering conventional song expectations, _as long as_:

- the pulse remains explicit but non-drum,
- the space stays near-field/dry,
- dynamics remain controlled (no payoff arcs).

Primary axis focus:

- Tonal anchor ↔ Pitch ambiguity (add a minimal anchor: one pitch only)
- Strong pulse ↔ Beatless recurrence (pulse stays readable)
- Static texture ↔ Eventful micro-editing (detail comes from edits, not harmony)

### Test track

**“Rust Halo on Linoleum”**

Constraints / intent:

- NO drum kit; rhythm from heel taps, coin clicks, paper flex, tiny object impacts.
- One-note drone only (single pitch, slightly detuned / bowed metal); NO chord progression.
- Micro-edits + phase drift provide motion; avoid “builds.”
- Saturation only on transients (local), not across the whole mix.
- Keep it close-mic and dry; minimal reverb.

Structure:
Intro (drone + room tone) → A (pulse enters) → B (denser edits, still steady) → Bridge (pulse thins, drone wavers) → C (max detail, no dynamic spike) → Outro (pulse dissolves, drone remains)

## What to probe next (avoid premature convergence)

If this scores higher:

- Try removing the tonal anchor again but keep identical pulse + micro-editing (is the anchor doing real work?).
- Try the same single-pitch anchor with _weaker_ pulse (does clarity collapse without time footholds?).

If this scores lower:

- The tonal anchor may read as “too musical” even without chords; next attempt could be fully pitchless but equally structured.
- The drone might be fatiguing; try “anchor by timbre” instead (recurring sound object) with no stable pitch.

Always:

- Favor audible constraints over genre labels.
- Avoid payoff mechanics; rely on returns, micro-change, and mix proximity.
