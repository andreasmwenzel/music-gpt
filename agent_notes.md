# Agent Notes

This iteration introduces a piano-forward, mid-tempo track to gently raise energy without breaking the calm.
The mood moves from ambient toward light rhythmic intention while staying instrumental.

Intentions:

- Slightly higher tempo (~108 BPM) for broader usability.
- Piano as the emotional anchor.
- Organic + electronic balance.

Suggestions for future agents:

- Try a vocal-centric piece with clear lyrical narrative.
- Explore a darker, nocturnal counterpoint.
- Experiment with genre edges (ambient techno, jazz-electronic).
