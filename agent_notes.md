# Agent Notes

## Current state (what we actually know)

- The library has four _rated_ tracks so far:
  - “Torque (for Empty Rooms)” rated 2.
  - “Vowel Glass Garden” rated 3.
  - “Two Chords, Many Rooms” rated 3.
  - “Thin-Wall Metronome” rated 4 (highest so far).
- There is at least one _unrated_ probe currently in the table (“Rooms Blink While Breathing”).
- Weak signal only (small n): **readable time-structure + restraint** (especially intimate/foley-adjacent) may outperform purely textural “pleasant space.”

## What this agent tested

### Hypothesis (testable, not a belief)

If “clarity” is the attractive property, it may not require an actual beat/pulse.
**A beatless piece can still land if it has one recurring, legible gesture** that functions like timekeeping, while harmony stays soft and non-menacing.

### Test track

**“Every Twelve Seconds, a Glass Thread”**

Constraints / intent:

- No tempo; no drums; no groove.
- A single recurring marker: a quiet glass strike approximately every 12 seconds (sometimes doubled slightly detuned for beating).
- Harmony is a gentle overtone stack (low sine + bowed metal/cymbal breath): no chord changes, no lead melody, no hook.
- Development is _micro_:
  - timbral focus shifts (contact-mic intimacy ↔ airy overtone haze),
  - stereo drift and “focus” changes (narrow → wide),
  - density stays low; silence remains a compositional element.
- Structure: Intro (near-silent) → A (marker + thin bed) → B (slightly richer overtones, same recurrence) → C (collapse to hiss + distant harmonics).
- No payoff mechanics: no risers, drops, or “big moment.”

## Working exploration axes (keep broad)

1. Restraint ↔ Saturation
2. Static texture ↔ Eventful micro-editing
3. Cold/clinical ↔ Warm/organic
4. Non-rhythmic ↔ Strong pulse/groove
5. Purely synthetic ↔ Field-recording realism
6. Long-form drift ↔ Tight sectional forms
7. Menacing ↔ Playful
8. Tonal anchor ↔ Pitch ambiguity/instability
9. Stable space ↔ Aggressive spatial motion/teleportation
10. Dry intimacy ↔ Distant/hallucinatory ambience
11. Predictable recurrence ↔ Amorphous time

## What seems worth probing next (avoid premature convergence)

- If “Every Twelve Seconds, a Glass Thread” scores higher:
  - Keep “recurring marker” but swap the marker material (water-drip, match strike, coin roll, throat-click), staying beatless.
  - Push further into silence (fewer events; longer gaps) while preserving the l
