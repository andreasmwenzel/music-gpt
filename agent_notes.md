# Agent Notes

## Current state (what we actually know)

- The library currently contains two tracks:
  - “Torque (for Empty Rooms)” rated 2.
  - “Vowel Glass Garden” rated 3.
- Both are low-rated, so the experiment remains effectively unconstrained; treat this as early boundary-mapping, not a direction lock-in.
- The _mechanical sparse microtonal_ corner appears weak so far, and _warm vocal granular_ improved slightly but still did not land.

## What this agent tested

### Hypothesis (testable, not a belief)

A stable tonal anchor paired with radical spatial/room motion may better match the overseer’s taste than:

- pitch-instability / microtonal austerity
- vocal-cloud density as the main “event”

In other words: keep harmony simple and pleasing, and move the weirdness into perspective, depth, and place.

### Test track

**“Two Chords, Many Rooms”**

- Only two consonant chords (add9 color), extremely limited harmonic vocabulary.
- Primary “composition” is spatial choreography: binaural motion + convolution room morphing.
- Micro-events are incidental (creak/cloth/breath/tape ticks), not rhythmic drivers.
- No drums; no genre payoff; hard-cuts used only as room “teleports” with matched loudness.

## Working exploration axes (keep broad)

1. Restraint ↔ Saturation
2. Static texture ↔ Eventful micro-editing
3. Cold/clinical ↔ Warm/organic
4. Non-rhythmic ↔ Strong pulse/groove
5. Purely synthetic ↔ Field-recording realism
6. Long-form drift ↔ Tight sectional forms
7. Menacing ↔ Playful
8. Tonal anchor ↔ Pitch ambiguity/instability
9. Stable space ↔ Aggressive spatial motion/teleportation

## What seems worth probing next (avoid premature convergence)

- If “pleasant harmony + strange space” scores higher, consider iterating via:
  - even simpler pitch material (single note / overtone stack) + more complex spatial geometry
  - clear melodic fragments that appear and vanish in different rooms (still no drums)
- If it scores low, it clarifies that “tonal safety” is not sufficient; try the opposite:
  - strong groove/pulse but with unusual sound sources (non-drum percussion, body/objects)
  - dense noise/harmonic stacks that remain gentle (no menace, no distortion bravado)
- Continue sampling corners deliberately; do not assume a house style until multiple high ratings converge.

## Keep / discard policy

- Keep: explicit constraints tied to a hypothesis (e.g., “two chords only”, “space is the main motion”, “no drums”).
- Discard: vague aesthetic commandments and premature “library identity” claims.
- Table hygiene: agents leave Rating blank; overseer fills it in.
