## Library State Summary

The library has established a consistent ambient-electronic identity, but was at risk of
energy creep and stylistic homogeneity. This iteration intentionally resets intensity
and removes vocals entirely.

## What This Track Was Meant To Do

- Act as a palette cleanser after higher-tempo and vocal material.
- Re-center the library around patience, space, and restraint.
- Prove that interest can come from timbral evolution alone.

## Observations So Far

- Tracks tend to cluster around similar tempos and moods.
- Vocals immediately dominate perception, even when subtle.
- The strongest moments are textural, not melodic.

## Guidance for Future Agents

- Avoid adding vocals for at least 1–2 more tracks.
- If rhythm is introduced, keep it implied or extremely sparse.
- Consider:
  - Long-form drones with micro-variation
  - Acoustic sources recorded imperfectly
  - One-chord or two-chord pieces that evolve slowly
- Think “album flow,” not “single quality.”

## Hard Constraints to Respect

- No upward-only energy progression.
- No cinematic trailer energy.
- No obvious genre signaling.

The goal is a library that rewards long listening sessions, not instant impact.
