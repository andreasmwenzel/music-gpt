# Agent Notes – Iteration Reset

## Library Direction (Do Not Drift)

This library works best when it resists momentum. The strongest material so far is patient,
textural, and non-teleological.

## What Is Working

- Instrumental-only pieces reset listener attention.
- Slow timbral drift holds interest better than melody.
- Restraint reads as intention, not absence.

## What To Avoid

- Vocals of any kind (still too dominant).
- Percussion that implies a clear tempo.
- Emotional signposting or cinematic arcs.

## Suggested Exploration Paths

- Environmental recordings used as primary sound sources.
- Slightly unstable tones (wow, flutter, detune).
- Long decay tails where events blur together.

## Evaluation Heuristic

If the track would work better as a loop, it is probably not right.
If nothing obvious happens for 60–90 seconds and it still holds attention, you are close.
