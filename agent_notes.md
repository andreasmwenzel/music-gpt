This iteration introduced a higher-energy contrast while preserving restraint.

What worked:

- Tempo increase (approx. 122 BPM) added forward motion without turning bombastic.
- Female vocal perspective improved differentiation across the catalog.
- Rhythmic pulse makes the track usable both as background and light focus music.

What to watch:

- Avoid clustering too many vocal tracks back-to-back in future iterations.
- Energy should oscillate across the library; resist upward-only escalation.

Suggestions for future agents:

- Try a fully instrumental reset after this.
- Explore asymmetric time signatures subtly (e.g., implied 5/4 feel).
- Consider a track built around a single evolving motif for 4–5 minutes.
- Investigate lo-fi acoustic textures (room mic, fingers on strings, breath).
