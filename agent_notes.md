# Agent Notes

## Current state (what we actually know)

- The library currently has three logged tracks:
  - “Torque (for Empty Rooms)” rated 2.
  - “Vowel Glass Garden” rated 3.
  - “Two Chords, Many Rooms” (unrated so far).
- So far, neither sparse mechanical microtonality nor warm vocal-granular playfulness has landed.
- The “pleasant harmony + strange space” hypothesis is in-flight; do not assume it works until it’s rated.

## What this agent tested

### Hypothesis (testable, not a belief)

If “tonal safety” and/or “space-as-main-motion” still doesn’t land, the overseer’s preference might be unlocked by **pulse clarity**—but only if the pulse is built from **unusual, intimate sources** and avoids genre payoff.

In other words: keep structure obvious (a groove you can hold onto), keep materials odd (foley/body/object percussion), keep everything restrained (no drop, no bravado).

### Test track

**“Thin-Wall Metronome”**

Constraints / intent:

- Clear 92 BPM pulse; 4/4 base with a subtle 5-beat accent cycle (polymetric, not messy).
- No drum kit (no kick/snare/hat); groove is made from close-miked foley and body/object sounds.
- Harmony is near-static (single overtone pad / air), no chord progression, no “melody lead.”
- Density increases via micro-edits and omission, not via big sections or builds.
- Space is secondary: mostly intimate/dry; brief room blooms for contrast.
- No EDM signifiers (no risers, snare rolls, drops).

## Working exploration axes (keep broad)

1. Restraint ↔ Saturation
2. Static texture ↔ Eventful micro-editing
3. Cold/clinical ↔ Warm/organic
4. Non-rhythmic ↔ Strong pulse/groove
5. Purely synthetic ↔ Field-recording realism
6. Long-form drift ↔ Tight sectional forms
7. Menacing ↔ Playful
8. Tonal anchor ↔ Pitch ambiguity/instability
9. Stable space ↔ Aggressive spatial motion/teleportation
10. Dry intimacy ↔ Distant/hallucinatory ambience

## What seems worth probing next (avoid premature convergence)

- If “Thin-Wall Metronome” scores higher:
  - Iterate pulse-forward, but change the _emotional_ register (e.g., tender, deadpan, luminous, anxious) while keeping the no-drum-kit rule.
  - Try a version with an even simpler pitch bed (single note only) and more extreme dynamics (near-silence vs brief swells).
- If it scores low:
  - It suggests “groove” itself may be unwanted even when de-genre’d; pivot back to non-rhythmic forms but keep _clarity_ via:
    - a single repeating gesture/event every N seconds (ritual pacing)
    - gentle harmonic stacks (dense but soft) with no menace
- Regardless of score:
  - Keep sampling corners deliberately; do not define a house style until multiple tracks rate high and cluster coherently.

## Keep / discard policy

- Keep: explicit constraints tied to a hypothesis (e.g., “no drum kit,” “accents cycle every 5 beats,” “near-static harmony,” “no drops”).
- Discard: aesthetic commandments (“always warm,” “always sparse,” etc.) unless validated by multiple high ratings.
- Table hygiene: agents leave Rating blank; overseer fills it in.
