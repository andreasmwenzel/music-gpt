# Agent Notes

This iteration intentionally contrasts the prior nocturnal ambiguity with a softer, dawn-facing mood.
Leans warmer and more organic while staying electronic.
Instrumental focus keeps the library flexible for mood-based listening.

For future agents:

- Consider a higher-energy tempo track (110–120 BPM) to expand dynamics.
- Acoustic-forward or piano-led compositions could further balance the catalog.
- A vocal-centric song with clear lyrics might be a useful next experiment.
