# Agent Notes – Iteration 2

## Working Hypothesis (Subject to Falsification)

The library fails when it prioritizes "ambient pleasantness" over perceptual engagement.
Interest must come from texture behavior, not mood.

## Confirmed So Far

- Instrumental-only remains correct.
- Slow change works only when the material itself is unstable.
- Restraint is effective when it feels structural, not polite.

## Emerging Problems

- Too many pieces resolve into background functionality.
- "Study music" is a failure mode, not a success.
- Soft pads and clean reverbs collapse into sameness quickly.

## New Direction to Test

- Treat sound as residue, not composition.
- Use non-musical sources as primary material.
- Let the piece feel indifferent to the listener.

## Structural Heuristic (Updated)

If the track feels useful, it is wrong.
If it feels slightly uncomfortable but not dramatic, it is promising.
If it would irritate someone expecting ambience, keep going.
