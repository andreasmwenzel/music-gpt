# Agent Notes

## Current state (what we actually know)

- The library currently has four rated tracks:
  - “Torque (for Empty Rooms)” rated 2.
  - “Vowel Glass Garden” rated 3.
  - “Two Chords, Many Rooms” rated 3.
  - “Thin-Wall Metronome” rated 4 (highest so far).
- So far, the clearest signal is that **pulse-forward restraint** may outperform purely textural or purely “pleasant space” approaches—but this is weak evidence (n=1).

## What this agent tested

### Hypothesis (testable, not a belief)

If pulse clarity is a viable unlock, the next sensitivity might be:
**emotional register + spatial motion**, not groove complexity.

Specifically: a _tender / luminous_ micro-pulse made from intimate sources may land better when the main “development” is **room-teleportation** (space changes) rather than density or harmonic movement.

### Test track

**“Rooms Blink While Breathing”**

Constraints / intent:

- 80 BPM, simple 4/4 pulse; clarity over cleverness.
- No drum kit; pulse from breath/clicks/paper/ceramic/skin sounds, close-miked and dry.
- Harmony = single sustained pitch (tonal anchor) with microtonal beating; no chord changes, no lead melody.
- Primary motion is spatial: abrupt reverb/room swaps every 8–16 bars (teleport cuts), brief binaural pans.
- Structure: A (near-silent, dry) → B (more frequent room swaps, slightly fuller drone) → C (collapse to breath + distant haze).
- No genre payoff: no drops, no risers, no “big moment.”

## Working exploration axes (keep broad)

1. Restraint ↔ Saturation
2. Static texture ↔ Eventful micro-editing
3. Cold/clinical ↔ Warm/organic
4. Non-rhythmic ↔ Strong pulse/groove
5. Purely synthetic ↔ Field-recording realism
6. Long-form drift ↔ Tight sectional forms
7. Menacing ↔ Playful
8. Tonal anchor ↔ Pitch ambiguity/instability
9. Stable space ↔ Aggressive spatial motion/teleportation
10. Dry intimacy ↔ Distant/hallucinatory ambience

## What seems worth probing next (avoid premature convergence)

- If “Rooms Blink While Breathing” scores higher:
  - Keep the **single-note anchor** and pulse clarity, but swap the _materials_ (e.g., metal-only, water-only, voice-only) while preserving “no kit.”
  - Try even slower tempos (60–70) with more extreme silence and fewer events (ritual pacing with pulse).
- If it scores low:
  - It suggests either (a) pulse is not the unlock, or (b) “teleporting space” is aversive.
  - Pivot to **non-rhythmic** but keep _clarity_ via one recurring gesture every N seconds, with soft harmonic stacks (no menace).
- Regardless of score:
  - Continue sampling corners; do not define a house style until multiple tracks cluster at high ratings.

## Keep / discard policy

- Keep: constraints tied to a hypothesis (e.g., “no drum kit,” “single-note anchor,” “teleporting rooms,” “no drops”).
- Discard: aesthetic commandments unless validated by multiple high ratings.
- Table hygiene: agents leave Rating blank; overseer fills it in.
