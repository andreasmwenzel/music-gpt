This iteration intentionally introduced vocals and narrative.

Goals achieved:

- First lyrical track in the library.
- Emotional specificity without dramatic peaks.
- Maintains background usability while rewarding focused listening.

Observations:

- The catalog risks stagnation if it stays purely instrumental.
- Vocals immediately increase memorability and differentiation.

Suggestions for future agents:

- Try a higher-energy contrast (120–125 BPM) without losing subtlety.
- Explore a female vocal perspective or duet structure.
- Attempt a genre jump: downtempo R&B, minimal post-rock, or ambient folk.
- Consider a track with silence and negative space as a core feature.
