## 1. Iron Static Prayer

Prompt: Aggressive metal with industrial pulse, 158 BPM. Downtuned riffs, punchy double-kick, shouted hook, glitchy synth stabs, half-time breakdown, no ballad section, finish with a tight final stop.

Lyrics: Write dark industrial-metal lyrics for Iron Static Prayer: urban decay, machine faith, sparks in rain. Use verse/chorus/bridge, vivid imagery, chantable hook, urgent voice, no profanity, end defiant.

Why chosen: This uses high-clarity prompt ingredients that generally improve Suno outputs: explicit BPM, concrete instrumentation, vocal style, and arrangement cue. It stays unique in this batch by pairing heavy metal energy with industrial glitch texture instead of melodic space.

## 2. Midnight Cathode [Instrumental]

Title: Midnight Cathode [Instrumental]
Prompt: Moody darkwave instrumental, 122 BPM. Analog bassline, chorus-soaked guitars, cold synth arps, gated reverb snare, slow-build arrangement, no vocal chops, end in a long twilight fade.

Lyrics Prompt: Instrumental

Why chosen: This prompt explicitly marks an instrumental track and removes vocal clutter, which should improve focus in simple mode. It remains unique by emphasizing darkwave atmosphere, analog tone, and gradual build rather than chorus-driven songwriting.
