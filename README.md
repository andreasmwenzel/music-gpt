# Music-GPT

A lighthearted attempt at creating some music for myself to enjoy

## Description

Each iteration, chat gpt gets the prompt, notes left by the last agent and a table of songs, rated by me. It's goal, to make me a music that I like.

This is all done with free chat-gpt and free Suno. I'll be generating about 10 (5x2) songs per day.

## Results

Every prompt can be found in music-prompt. I'll be updating the playlist here:
