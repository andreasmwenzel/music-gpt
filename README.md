# Music-GPT

A lighthearted attempt at creating some music for myself to enjoy

## Description

Each iteration, chat gpt gets the prompt, notes left by the last agent and a table of songs, rated by me. It's goal, to make me a music that I like.

This is all done with free chat-gpt and free Suno. I'll be generating about 10 (5x2) songs per day.

### How I us it

1. I upload the two files, then copy and paste the prompt into the prompt field on ChatGPT.
2. I go to Suno and enter the title, lyrics and style block the response gave me.
3. I record the answers and rate the song
4. I delete that chat and never use the same chat instance twice.

This is the Ralph (if you know, you know) of music generation.

## Results

Every prompt can be found in music-prompt. I'll be updating the playlist here:

## Major Changes

- After just 8 songs, I decided my prompt was too far off. So why not let Chat-GPT help me write one that will help me better achieve what I want. I will be restarting the experiment with this new prompt.
