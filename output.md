## Today

### 1. Neon Funeral Bloom

Prompt: Darkwave, 112 BPM. Gloomy analog bass pulse, cold drum machine, chorus-soaked guitar swells, icy mezzo vocal, tense verse, soaring minor-key chorus, cathedral reverb tail.

Lyrics Prompt: Write lyrics for Neon Funeral Bloom (Darkwave): city blackout vigil turning euphoric. Icy intimate verses, dramatic minor-key hook, candle-and-neon imagery, sorrow to resolve.

Why chosen: Darkwave was still unused in the active pool, so this expands coverage while matching your moody melodic preferences. The vigil-to-release arc and cathedral ambience keep it distinct from prior electronic tracks.

### 2. Static Civic Hymn

Prompt: Post-punk, 138 BPM. Driving picked bass, brittle guitars, dry snare, clipped baritone lead, anxious verse groove, wide gang chorus, dissonant bridge, abrupt stop ending.

Lyrics Prompt: Write lyrics for Static Civic Hymn (Post-Punk): late-night protest march under flickering signs. Clipped detached verses, chantable chorus, concrete street details, restless but determined tone.

Why chosen: Post-punk adds wiry momentum and spoken-edge delivery absent from the current set. The abrupt-stop structure and anxious bass-led groove prevent overlap with earlier anthem-style rock songs.

### 3. Pavement Fist Parade

Prompt: Punk rock, 182 BPM. Buzzsaw guitars, fast 2-beat drums, shouted unison hooks, gang backing yells, no-frills mix, breakneck verses, half-time bridge, explosive final refrain.

Lyrics Prompt: Write lyrics for Pavement Fist Parade (Punk Rock): friends reclaim a dead mall for a DIY show. Rapid punchy lines, shouted hooks, sarcastic grit, rebellious joy, communal ending.

Why chosen: Punk rock fills another zero-history lane with maximal urgency and a stripped production profile. The DIY setting and speed-first arrangement keep it sonically separate from pop-punk and alternative entries.

### 4. Quartz Skyline Run

Prompt: EDM, 128 BPM. Four-on-floor kick, sidechained supersaw chords, bright pluck motif, chopped vocal lead, tension riser into huge drop, filtered breakdown, euphoric last chorus.

Lyrics Prompt: Write lyrics for Quartz Skyline Run (EDM): rooftop race at sunrise after an all-night rave. Breathless vivid lines, uplifting hook, kinetic pacing, glittering urban imagery, triumphant release.

Why chosen: This supplies a pure festival-leaning EDM cut with clearer drop architecture than your glitch/synth variants. The sunrise rooftop narrative adds vivid specificity without repeating past themes.

### 5. Smoke Dial Lullaby

Prompt: Trip hop, 88 BPM. Lazy breakbeat, upright bass throb, muted trumpet swells, dusty Rhodes, whispered tenor-contralto duet, noir verse, melodic refrain, tape wow flutter.

Lyrics Prompt: Write lyrics for Smoke Dial Lullaby (Trip Hop): two night-shift callers connect over static. Whispered slow lines, noir tenderness, tactile radio imagery, guarded longing, bittersweet refrain.

Why chosen: Trip hop now gets a contrasting entry centered on duet intimacy instead of solo confession. The muted trumpet and radio motif introduce a fresh cinematic texture while keeping the genre's slow-burn groove.
