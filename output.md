## Today

### 1. Neon Exit Velocity

Prompt: Cinematic synthwave, 118 BPM. Pulsing analog bass, bright arps, wide tom fills, soaring chorus vocal, sidechain pads, key-change final chorus, clean mix, no guitar solos.

Lyrics Prompt: Write lyrics for Neon Exit Velocity: night freeway escape, blue lights, hope after burnout. Verse/chorus/bridge, concise images, big singalong hook, PG language, end on sunrise.

Why chosen: This fits your electronic side while keeping structure explicit for stronger Suno outputs. It contrasts the darker prior tracks with bright momentum and a melodic chorus focus. The arrangement cue and key-change ending keep it distinct.

### 2. Briar Crown Oath

Prompt: Folk metal at 154 BPM. Galloping drums, tremolo guitars, fiddle and tin whistle leads, gang-chant chorus, minor-key verse to triumphant major chorus, tight 3:30 arrangement.

Lyrics Prompt: Write lyrics for Briar Crown Oath: forest rebellion, old vows, iron and cedar. Verse/chorus/bridge, mythic imagery, chantable refrain, no archaic overload, finish victorious.

Why chosen: This targets folk metal directly with concrete instrument calls and a clear section arc. It gives you a heavier anthem but avoids repeating the industrial flavor from earlier metal history. The tonal shift from minor to major adds a fresh lift.

### 3. Mercury Lane Pressure [Instrumental]

Prompt: High-energy drum and bass instrumental, 174 BPM. Reese bass, crisp amen edits, airy pads, filter-rise drops, switch to halftime middle eight, no vocals, punchy sub and clean highs.

Lyrics Prompt: Instrumental

Why chosen: This introduces high-speed rhythmic variety and keeps the run from over-indexing on vocal songs. The prompt is tightly audible, with breakbeat, bass design, and arrangement switches spelled out. It is also clearly separated from synthwave by tempo and drum language.

### 4. Velvet Static Letters

Prompt: Smoky trip hop, 92 BPM. Dusty breakbeat, upright bass, Rhodes chords, vinyl crackle, intimate alto vocal, sparse verses and late chorus bloom, tape-saturated texture.

Lyrics Prompt: Write lyrics for Velvet Static Letters: unsent messages, midnight kitchen light, quiet regret turning to resolve. Free-verse verses with short chorus line, intimate tone, no profanity.

Why chosen: This pushes into low-tempo, textural mood with a very different groove profile than the other picks. Specific production cues should help Suno land the desired atmosphere quickly. The lyrical concept stays personal and restrained to avoid overlap with epic themes.

### 5. Saltglass Reverie

Prompt: Dreamy shoegaze, 128 BPM. Layered fuzz guitars, driving bass, motorik drums, breathy duet vocal, wall-of-sound chorus, brief clean bridge, end with swirling feedback tail.

Lyrics Prompt: Write lyrics for Saltglass Reverie: ocean haze, blurred memories, holding on without closure. Verse/chorus/bridge, impressionistic images, repeated hook phrase, gentle but determined voice.

Why chosen: This delivers guitar-heavy haze without repeating metal aggression. The prompt includes concrete mix and arrangement landmarks so the song can build dynamically instead of staying flat. Its emotional tone is wistful but forward-moving, unique in this set.
