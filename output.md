## Today

### 1. Fluorescent Shoulder

Prompt: Anthemic alternative rock, 136 BPM. Crunchy rhythm guitars, melodic lead line, tight live drums, warm bass, earnest tenor vocal, quiet verse into explosive chorus, short bridge.

Lyrics Prompt: Write lyrics for Fluorescent Shoulder (Alternative Rock): gritty night-shift hope, earnest tenor. Quiet reflective verses, explosive anthemic chorus, concrete images, PG tone, resilient ending.

Why chosen: This seeds alternative rock with a clear quiet-loud dynamic and strong melodic center. The prompt is specific on instrumentation and arrangement, which should help consistency. It also avoids overlap with the heavier punk and industrial entries.

### 2. 8-Bit Heartline

Prompt: Chiptune rock, 164 BPM. Square-wave arps, bitcrushed lead, palm-muted guitars, snappy acoustic drums, dual vocal shouts, stop-start pre-chorus, soaring chorus, playful aggression.

Lyrics Prompt: Write lyrics for 8-Bit Heartline (Chiptune Rock): playful-defiant arcade romance. Punchy short lines, stop-start pre-chorus, dual-shout chorus, repeat one hook, bright tone, no nostalgia cliches.

Why chosen: This establishes chiptune rock with explicit chip timbres plus live-band energy. The style prompt includes arrangement checkpoints to prevent a flat loop. It stays unique by blending playful tones with a driving rock chorus.

### 3. Subzero Warning

Prompt: Modern dubstep, 148 BPM. Ominous intro pad, spoken hype line, syncopated growl-bass drops, triplet fills, crisp snare, fake-out second drop, sparse break, heavy clean sub.

Lyrics Prompt: Write lyrics for Subzero Warning (Dubstep): storm-night survival. Sparse short verses, one spoken hype line, pre-drop chant, clipped chorus for syncopated drops, dark mood, resilient close.

Why chosen: This fills the dubstep slot with concrete drop architecture and bass-design cues. The prompt should produce clearer contrast between intro, drops, and break sections. It adds high-impact electronic weight without repeating drum and bass pacing.

### 4. Brassline Roulette

Prompt: Electro-swing at 124 BPM. Walking upright bass, brass stabs, gypsy-jazz guitar, four-on-floor kick, female lead vocal, scat ad-libs, clarinet breakdown, glossy club mix.

Lyrics Prompt: Write lyrics for Brassline Roulette (Electro-Swing): smoky speakeasy flirtation with witty swagger. Rhythmic phrasing, female lead plus scat ad-libs, call-and-response chorus, playful PG confidence.

Why chosen: This seeds electro-swing with unmistakable acoustic and dance-floor markers. The instrumentation constraints should keep the genre identity strong. It also broadens palette variety with brighter groove and theatrical vocal phrasing.

### 5. Parking Lot Polaroids

Prompt: Pop-punk, 178 BPM. Bright power chords, driving bass, punchy drums, nasal lead vocal, gang backups, verse to huge chorus, quick halftime bridge, polished energetic mix.

Lyrics Prompt: Write lyrics for Parking Lot Polaroids (Pop-Punk): fast bittersweet summer fallout. Conversational verses, gang-backup chorus chant, simple rhyme punches, no profanity, hopeful final turn.

Why chosen: This completes the seeded set with a punchy pop-punk entry built for hook density. The prompt balances polish with energy using explicit section cues. It remains distinct from punk rock via cleaner production and melodic emphasis.
