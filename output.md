## Today

### 1. Neon Chapel Ash

Prompt: Darkwave, 112 BPM. Gated drums, chorus bass pulse, cold analog pads, baritone vocal with whispered doubles, minor-key verse, towering synth-choir chorus, decaying tape hiss outro.

Lyrics Prompt: Write lyrics for Neon Chapel Ash (Darkwave): midnight procession through rain-lit ruins. Low solemn diction, hypnotic pacing, sacred-urban imagery, restrained grief opening into fierce resolve.

Why chosen: Darkwave expands the library into brooding synth-rock territory that was missing from prior runs. The baritone delivery and ritual atmosphere keep it distinct from brighter electronic entries.

### 2. Wireflower Parade

Prompt: Post-punk, 138 BPM. Driving picked bass, brittle guitars, snare-forward drums, detached alto vocal, angular verse riff, chant-hook chorus, dubby bridge delay, abrupt stop ending.

Lyrics Prompt: Write lyrics for Wireflower Parade (Post-Punk): workers dancing through surveillance glare. Dry observational verses, clipped phrasing, sardonic hook refrain, tense momentum with flashes of joy.

Why chosen: This introduces post-punk's wiry rhythmic focus and social edge without overlapping with recent alternative-rock anthems. The abrupt ending and dubby bridge provide a different structural fingerprint.

### 3. Slow Signal Lanterns

Prompt: Trip hop, 86 BPM. Dusty breakbeat, upright bass plucks, tremolo Rhodes, muted trumpet swells, intimate mezzo vocal, smoke-thick verse, half-time chorus drift, vinyl crackle texture.

Lyrics Prompt: Write lyrics for Slow Signal Lanterns (Trip Hop): late-night ferry crossing after a hard goodbye. Soft conversational lines, noir imagery, unhurried cadence, bittersweet calm with hidden ache.

Why chosen: Trip hop adds low-BPM cinematic mood to balance the catalog's high-energy tracks. The jazz-leaning instrumentation and hushed vocal tone make it clearly separate from glitch-driven electronic songs.

### 4. Laser Halo Run

Prompt: EDM, 128 BPM. Four-on-floor kick, bright supersaw stack, plucked synth groove, female lead with vocoder harmonies, tension riser pre-drop, euphoric drop, chopped-vocal post-chorus.

Lyrics Prompt: Write lyrics for Laser Halo Run (EDM): sprinting toward sunrise after an all-night rave. Uplifting concise lines, breathless momentum, collective-we chorus, ecstatic release over steady pulse.

Why chosen: EDM stays in rotation while shifting toward classic festival uplift and cleaner melodic focus. The vocoder harmonies and chopped-vocal post-chorus avoid overlap with darker club textures.

### 5. Asphalt Anthem Teeth

Prompt: Punk rock, 182 BPM. Buzzsaw guitars, relentless eighth-note bass, slammed drums, raw unison shouts, 2-chord verse sprint, gang-chorus hook, 12-second solo, crash-stop finale.

Lyrics Prompt: Write lyrics for Asphalt Anthem Teeth (Punk Rock): friends reclaiming their block from corrupt landlords. Fast blunt lines, shouted slogans, sarcastic bite, communal defiance and no-frills urgency.

Why chosen: Punk rock contributes maximum velocity and stripped-down aggression not yet represented in this reset. Its two-chord sprint and shout-led hook add a new intensity profile across the set.
