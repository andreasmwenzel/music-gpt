## Today

### 1. Glass Riot Summer

Prompt: Alternative rock, 142 BPM. Jagged guitar stabs, rubbery bass, dry punchy drums, urgent alto vocal, tense verse to wide hook chorus, gang-tail outro, minimal reverb.

Lyrics Prompt: Write lyrics for Glass Riot Summer (Alternative Rock): heatwave street unrest turning into unity. Urgent clipped verses, big hook chorus, vivid city details, defiant but hopeful tone.

Why chosen: This keeps alternative rock in rotation with sharper rhythmic attack and a higher-tempo hook than prior entries. The dry mix and gang-tail finish make it feel fresh without repeating earlier anthemic structures.

### 2. Spritefire Overdrive

Prompt: Chiptune rock, 168 BPM. FM arps, crunchy square lead, live snare with tom fills, muted guitar chugs, call-and-response vocals, fake-out break, victory-lap final chorus.

Lyrics Prompt: Write lyrics for Spritefire Overdrive (Chiptune Rock): co-op escape through collapsing levels. Fast playful diction, shouted response hooks, high-energy momentum, triumphant finish.

Why chosen: This entry leans into game-coded tension and release while pushing more live-drum muscle than the previous chiptune cut. The fake-out break and call-response design clearly separate its arrangement profile.

### 3. Mossblade Oath

Prompt: Folk metal, 124 BPM. Fiddle riffs, tin whistle accents, galloping kick, tremolo guitars, choir-backed baritone, tavern-chant pre-chorus, stormy bridge, massive unison finale.

Lyrics Prompt: Write lyrics for Mossblade Oath (Folk Metal): forest clans unite before a winter siege. Mythic imagery, baritone narrative verses, chantable chorus, fierce communal resolve.

Why chosen: Folk metal adds organic instrumentation and communal chant energy not present in the current history set. It broadens the catalog while still fitting the user's taste for dramatic, high-contrast arrangements.

### 4. Subway Ghost Codec

Prompt: Glitch hop, 100 BPM. Stuttered vocal chops, swung drums, sub wobble bursts, detuned keys, sparse rap verse, elastic drop groove, tape-stop fills, nocturnal neon atmosphere.

Lyrics Prompt: Write lyrics for Subway Ghost Codec (Glitch Hop): midnight train heist in digital fog. Cool sly verses, syncopated phrasing, fragmented hook, stealthy tension with playful swagger.

Why chosen: This track explores off-grid groove and rhythmic sound design to diversify the electronic side of the library. Its low-BPM swing and fragmented hook avoid overlap with four-on-the-floor or high-BPM drum styles.

### 5. Velvet Static Shore

Prompt: Shoegaze, 96 BPM. Washed guitars, tremolo haze, soft floor-tom pulse, chorus bass drift, breathy duet, buried verses, luminous chorus bloom, long feedback fade.

Lyrics Prompt: Write lyrics for Velvet Static Shore (Shoegaze): shoreline memories blur into dawn. Hushed intimate lines, slow dreamy pacing, impressionistic images, aching yet gentle release.

Why chosen: Shoegaze introduces a dreamy low-intensity palette, balancing the run after several aggressive rhythm-driven tracks. The duet texture and buried vocal treatment give a distinct emotional and sonic identity.
