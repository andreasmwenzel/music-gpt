## Laser Halo Run

### Style

EDM, 128 BPM. Four-on-floor kick, bright supersaw stack, plucked synth groove, female lead with vocoder harmonies, tension riser pre-drop, euphoric drop, chopped-vocal post-chorus.

### Lyrics

Write lyrics for Laser Halo Run (EDM): sprinting toward sunrise after an all-night rave. Uplifting concise lines, breathless momentum, collective-we chorus, ecstatic release over steady pulse.
