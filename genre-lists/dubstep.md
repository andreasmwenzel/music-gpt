Modern dubstep, 148 BPM. Ominous intro pad, spoken hype line, syncopated growl-bass drops, triplet fills, crisp snare, fake-out second drop, sparse break, heavy clean sub.

### Lyrics

Write lyrics for Subzero Warning: storm sirens, blackout streets, moving as one through chaos. Short verses, pre-drop chant, simple chorus phrase, tense mood, resilient finish.
