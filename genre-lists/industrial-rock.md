# Industrial Rock

## Factory Halo

### Style

Industrial rock at 142 BPM. Distorted bass, palm-muted riffs, metallic percussion loops, gritty baritone vocal, stomping chorus, sparse machine-ambience bridge, aggressive controlled mix.

### Lyrics

Write lyrics for Factory Halo: steel dust, overtime ghosts, finding dignity in noise. Verse/chorus/bridge, concrete imagery, memorable refrain, no profanity, end with stubborn hope.
