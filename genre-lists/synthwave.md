## Midnight Circuit Glass

### Style

Cinematic synthwave, 112 BPM. Pulsing analog bass, chorus-soaked pads, arpeggiated plucks, Linn-style snare, airy female lead, restrained verse, neon-lift chorus, instrumental outro swell.

### Lyrics

Write lyrics for Midnight Circuit Glass (Synthwave): neon solitude on empty highways. Intimate airy diction, restrained verses, expansive chorus, late-night momentum, bittersweet forward motion.
