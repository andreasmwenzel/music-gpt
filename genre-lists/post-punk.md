## Static Civic Hymn

### Style

Post-punk, 138 BPM. Driving picked bass, brittle guitars, dry snare, clipped baritone lead, anxious verse groove, wide gang chorus, dissonant bridge, abrupt stop ending.

### Lyrics

Write lyrics for Static Civic Hymn (Post-Punk): late-night protest march under flickering signs. Clipped detached verses, chantable chorus, concrete street details, restless but determined tone.
