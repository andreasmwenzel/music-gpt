# Post-Punk

## Wireflower Parade

### Style

Post-punk, 138 BPM. Driving picked bass, brittle guitars, snare-forward drums, detached alto vocal, angular verse riff, chant-hook chorus, dubby bridge delay, abrupt stop ending.

### Lyrics

Write lyrics for Wireflower Parade (Post-Punk): workers dancing through surveillance glare. Dry observational verses, clipped phrasing, sardonic hook refrain, tense momentum with flashes of joy.
