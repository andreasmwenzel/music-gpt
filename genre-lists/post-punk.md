# Post-Punk

## Wirelight District

### Style

Moody post-punk, 132 BPM. Driving bassline, angular guitars, dry snare, tense unison vocal, minimal verse into expansive chorus, cold reverb tails, nocturnal city atmosphere.

### Lyrics

Write lyrics for Wirelight District: city rain, surveillance glow, trying to stay human. Verse/chorus/bridge, clipped phrasing, recurring anchor line, restrained emotion, unresolved but forward close.
