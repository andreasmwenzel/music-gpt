# Shoegaze

## Velvet Static Shore

### Style

Shoegaze, 96 BPM. Washed guitars, tremolo haze, soft floor-tom pulse, chorus bass drift, breathy duet, buried verses, luminous chorus bloom, long feedback fade.

### Lyrics

Write lyrics for Velvet Static Shore (Shoegaze): shoreline memories blur into dawn. Hushed intimate lines, slow dreamy pacing, impressionistic images, aching yet gentle release.
