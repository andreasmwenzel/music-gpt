# Punk Rock

## Pavement Fist Parade

### Style

Punk rock, 182 BPM. Buzzsaw guitars, fast 2-beat drums, shouted unison hooks, gang backing yells, no-frills mix, breakneck verses, half-time bridge, explosive final refrain.

### Lyrics

Write lyrics for Pavement Fist Parade (Punk Rock): friends reclaim a dead mall for a DIY show. Rapid punchy lines, shouted hooks, sarcastic grit, rebellious joy, communal ending.
