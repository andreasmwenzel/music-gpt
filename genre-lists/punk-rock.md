# Punk Rock

## Exit Sign Anthem

### Style

Fast punk rock, 186 BPM. Buzzsaw guitars, live-room drums, raw shout-sing vocal, gang-chant chorus, short verse bursts, one quick breakdown, no polished pop sheen, hard stop ending.

### Lyrics

Write lyrics for Exit Sign Anthem: dead-end jobs, late-night bus rides, choosing your own way. Verse/chorus/bridge, punchy lines, chant hook, PG language, defiant closing image.
