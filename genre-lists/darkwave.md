# Darkwave

## Neon Chapel Ash

### Style

Darkwave, 112 BPM. Gated drums, chorus bass pulse, cold analog pads, baritone vocal with whispered doubles, minor-key verse, towering synth-choir chorus, decaying tape hiss outro.

### Lyrics

Write lyrics for Neon Chapel Ash (Darkwave): midnight procession through rain-lit ruins. Low solemn diction, hypnotic pacing, sacred-urban imagery, restrained grief opening into fierce resolve.
