# Darkwave

## Neon Funeral Bloom

### Style

Darkwave, 112 BPM. Gloomy analog bass pulse, cold drum machine, chorus-soaked guitar swells, icy mezzo vocal, tense verse, soaring minor-key chorus, cathedral reverb tail.

### Lyrics

Write lyrics for Neon Funeral Bloom (Darkwave): city blackout vigil turning euphoric. Icy intimate verses, dramatic minor-key hook, candle-and-neon imagery, sorrow to resolve.
