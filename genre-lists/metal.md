# Metal

## Iron Bloom Static

### Style

Modern metal, 158 BPM. Down-tuned chugs, double-kick drive, dissonant lead bends, wide tom fills, harsh verse scream to clean chorus, half-time breakdown, tight gated room reverb.

### Lyrics

Write lyrics for Iron Bloom Static (Metal): pressure-cooker resolve in a collapsing city. Harsh clipped verses, clean hook chorus, concrete steel-and-sparks imagery, stern but hopeful close.
