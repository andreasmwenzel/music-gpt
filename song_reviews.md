| Static Between Stars            | 3      | Good Start                  |
| Glass Hours at Dawn             | 2      | Could be good study music   |
| Warm Circuits, Open Windows     | 2      | Feels like more of the same |
| Rooms We Never Learned to Leave |        |                             |
