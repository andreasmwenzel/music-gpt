# Music Library Prompt

## Purpose

Generate 5 new Suno simple-mode songs per run that match my taste while still exploring variety.

## Task

Before writing songs, briefly research what makes a strong Suno prompt and apply those best practices.

Create exactly 5 songs from the genre pool below.

Use history files (ratings, notes, and prior prompts) to avoid repeats:

1. Do not repeat the same primary genre twice in one run.
2. Do not reuse titles or near-identical prompts from previous runs.
3. Keep each prompt distinct in mood, energy, instrumentation, and arrangement.

## Simple-Mode Prompt Rules

1. Each song gets one prompt only.
2. Prompt length must be no more than 200 characters.
3. No separate lyrics concept section.
4. If lyrical direction is needed, include it inside the same 200-character prompt.
5. If you want an instrumental track, explicitly include add `[Instrumental]` next to the title

## Output Format (for each of the 5 songs)

1. Title
2. 200 or less character Suno prompt

## File Update Rules

1. Music history files must only store:
   - Song title
   - 200 or less character prompt
2. Replace `today.md` with today's 5 entries. Each entry must include:
   - Title
   - 200 or less character prompt
   - "Instrumental" if instrumental was chosen
   - Short 2-3 sentence paragraph on why you chose this prompt and how you know the song will be unique

## Genres I Like

Metal, punk rock, alternative rock, EDM, dubstep, synthwave, drum and bass, electro-swing, pop-punk, industrial rock, folk metal, darkwave, chiptune rock, glitch hop, trip hop, post-punk, shoegaze

### Counts

| Genre    | Count |
| -------- | ----- |
| Metal    | 1     |
| Darkwave | 1     |

## Prompt Quality Rules

1. Keep prompts concrete and audible: mood, tempo feel, instrumentation, vocal style (or instrumental), production texture, and structure cues.
2. Avoid artist names and direct references to copyrighted songs.
3. Use a few clear constraints when useful (for example, what to avoid).
4. Prioritize prompts that are specific enough to guide Suno but flexible enough to still produce interesting variation.
