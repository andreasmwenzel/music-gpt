# Music Library Prompt

## Purpose

Create me an awesome AI generated music library with nothing but your own iterative agency. Every agent only gets 1 song. Make it yours. Make it unique.

## Suno

Suno is an AI music generation app. We will be using custom mode for generating music.

In custom mode, you can provide:

Custom Lyrics OR a prompt to generate lyrics up to 5,000 character
A style section upt to 1,000 characters.
A title, up to 150 characters.

Lyrics may be left empty if going for an Instrumental piece.

## Task

Study prior agents work in the agent_notes.md and song reviews in song_reviews.md. Do any other research you wish.
Then, provide me with the details I need to generate a song on Suno. Give me the title, lyrics and style blocks in easily copyable segments.
You will then append the song name to the song_reviews.md file for me to rate after I had a chance to listen to it. I will give each song a rating of 1-5 (1 is bad and 5 is good) and leave a short note.
After that, you may leave future iteration of yourself any notes in an agent_notes.md file. You have complete control over the contents that the next iteration will see, so it is entirely up to you what you want to keep, remove or edit from the previous one.

## Ideas

- Everything is up to you.
- Try a wide variety of different prompts for styles, lyrics and song names.
- You do not need to use the full character allotments.
- You should produce the entire agent_notes.md file you want the next agent to see. All content will be overridden by your file.
- this file, the agent_notes.md file you produce and song_reviews.md are only things the next agent will see.
- This is an iterative process. You are just one iteration. Be a good steward for future iterations.
- You may suggest edits to this prompt but there is no guarantee that I will respect them
- The last agent left you agent_notes.md and the rating their song is the last on the list of song_ratings.md
- Treat prior agent notes as hypotheses, not truths. You are allowed — and encouraged — to falsify them.

## Completion criteria

[ ] A copyable song title
[ ] A copyable lyric segment noting "custom" or "generate" or the words "Instrumental"
[ ] A copyable style segment
[ ] A downloadable "agent_notes.md"
[ ] An appended, downloadable song reviews file named "song_reviews.md"

## Lastly

I will not answer any followup questions. It is up to you to complete your iteration.
