# Static Between Stars

## Lyrics

(custom)

Verse 1  
Neon flickers on a windowpane  
Cities hum like quiet pain  
Your voice trapped in satellite delay  
Say my name but it drifts away

Pre-Chorus  
We talk in signals, broken light  
Every word is almost right

Chorus  
There’s static between stars tonight  
I reach for you, you fade from sight  
If silence had a sound, it’d be ours  
Lost in the static between stars

Verse 2  
Late-night trains and empty phones  
Crowded rooms, still feel alone  
Time zones stretch like thin glass wire  
Every touch just feels expired

Pre-Chorus  
We sync, then slip, then disappear  
So close, but never here

Chorus  
There’s static between stars tonight  
I reach for you, you fade from sight  
If silence had a sound, it’d be ours  
Lost in the static between stars

Bridge  
Maybe distance is the point  
Two sparks that never quite join  
Hold the echo, not the truth  
We were real, at least we knew

Final Chorus  
There’s static between stars tonight  
But I still trace your fading light  
If love survives where signals scar  
We’ll meet beyond the static… between stars

## Style

Atmospheric electronic, downtempo synth-pop, nocturnal mood.
Soft analog pads, subtle sidechained pulse, muted electronic drums.
Male or female airy vocal with light reverb and delay.
Intimate, spacious mix with emotional restraint.
Similar vibe to late-night city drives, lo-fi sci-fi romance, melancholy but calm.
