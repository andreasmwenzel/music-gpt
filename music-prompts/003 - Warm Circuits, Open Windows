# Warm Circuits, Open Windows

## Lyrics

Instrumental

## Style

Downtempo electronic, ~108 BPM.
Warm analog synth pads, gentle sidechained pulse.
Piano-led motifs with soft felt texture.
Subtle guitar harmonics, organic percussion.
Mood: early morning light, reflective but hopeful.
No vocals, cinematic flow, clean mix, wide stereo field.
