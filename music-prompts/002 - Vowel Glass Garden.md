## Style

Experimental electronic / electroacoustic. Test: warm + bright “vocal-as-texture” with playful dissonance, avoiding industrial/menacing cues. No narrative lyrics; only phonemes/vowels. NO DRUMS/PERCUSSION (no kicks, snares, hats). Imply motion with rhythmic gating, choppy edits, and breath patterns (~88–94 bpm feel without a beat).
Sound palette: close-mic airy choir fragments, granular choir clouds, glass harmonics/bowed crystal, kalimba or pizz plucks, prepared-piano ticks, soft tape flutter, gentle sub swells (minimal).
Harmony: near-diatonic clusters with microtonal inflections; bright intervals; avoid dark drones.
Structure (4–5 min): sparse vowel droplets + glass → abrupt hard-cut into dense granular choir cloud → short simple tonal clearing → second hard-cut montage of micro-edits → dissolve to one sustained vowel.
Mix/production: wide stereo with slow circular motion; “aggressively strange spatialization” applied to simple tones; clear transients; keep headroom/dynamics; no loud mastering, no EDM drop, no big payoff cadence.
