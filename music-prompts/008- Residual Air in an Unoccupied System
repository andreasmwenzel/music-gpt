# Neon Breathing Room

## Lyrics

Instrumental

## Style

Instrumental experimental ambient constructed from non-musical source material.
Primary sound sources: filtered HVAC noise, distant electrical hums, lightly processed room tone, and degraded field recordings.
No percussion, no rhythmic grid, no pulse.
Focus on extremely slow spectral shifts, subtle phase interference, and long decay tails that overlap into near-stasis.
Dynamic range is narrow but not flat—micro-movements matter.
Avoid melody entirely; any pitch content should feel incidental rather than composed.
The piece should feel like a system continuing after human intention has left the room.
