# Neon Breathing Room

## Lyrics

Instrumental

## Style

Instrumental ambient / modern classical hybrid.
Slow to mid-slow tempo (≈88 BPM), no drums in the first half.
Primary motif introduced on felt piano, repeating with slight timing imperfections.
Secondary textures: low-volume bowed guitar harmonics, room-tone noise, subtle breath artifacts.
Gradual harmonic drift over 4–5 minutes; no traditional verse/chorus structure.
Dynamics stay restrained; emotional arc comes from timbre evolution, not loudness.
Intimate, close-mic feel—like sitting alone in a quiet room at night.
Avoid cinematic swells, avoid lo-fi hip-hop tropes, avoid melodic hooks.
