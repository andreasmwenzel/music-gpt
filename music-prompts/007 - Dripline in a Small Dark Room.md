# Dripline in a Small Dark Room

## Lyrics

## Style

Ambient electronic, intimate foley minimalism, slow fragile pulse (~55 BPM).
MUST: recurring water-drip “tick” as primary timekeeper; ONE tonal anchor only (single low note, no chord changes); close-mic roomtone; micro-edits; restraint; short silences as punctuation.
SOUND: water drips + fingertip glass rub + soft cloth friction + distant sub-hum (single pitch) + occasional bowed metal “glint” (very sparse).
MIX: mostly dry/near; subtle stereo breathing (narrow → wider) in B section only; no big reverbs, no dramatic builds.
NO: drum kit, snare/clap, EDM drops, risers, chord progression, lead melody, vocal lyrics.
Structure: Intro (roomtone + first drip) → A (dripline + anchor tone) → B (add glass rub + wider image) → C (nearly bare: drip + room) → A’ (return thinner, slightly darker) → Outro (anchor fades, leave drip + room).
