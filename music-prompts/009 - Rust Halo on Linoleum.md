# Rust Halo on Linoleum

## Lyrics

## Style

Near-field electroacoustic, dry intimate mix, steady non-drum pulse.
Must-haves: foley percussion (heel taps, coin clicks, paper flex), one-note tonal anchor (single pitch drone, slightly detuned), micro-edits, subtle phase drift, close-mic texture, low dynamic range.
Must-nots: NO drum kit, NO chord progression, NO EDM build/drop, NO wide “festival” reverb, NO lead vocal narrative.
Sound palette: bowed metal/monostring drone, small motor whirr, breath hiss as texture (non-lexical), occasional restrained saturation on transient hits only.
Form: Intro (drone + room noise) → A (pulse introduced) → B (micro-edits + thicker foley) → Bridge (pulse thins, drone wavers) → C (densest detail, still steady) → Outro (pulse dissolves, drone remains)
