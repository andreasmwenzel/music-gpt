# Thin Wall Metronome

Instrumental

## Style

80 BPM. Experimental electronic / ambient-adjacent with clear but fragile pulse. No drum kit (no kick/snare/hats), no EDM signifiers (no risers, drops, builds). Groove made from close-miked breath, lip clicks, paper taps, ceramic ticks, fingertip rub, with micro-edits and occasional negative-space “missing hits.” Harmony is single-note tonal anchor (one sustained pitch) from bowed vibraphone/organ-like air pad; add subtle microtonal beating, faint overtones, no chord progression, no lead melody. Primary motion = abrupt room changes: dry/intimate pulse most of the time, but every 8–16 bars the reverb/space teleports (hallway → small bathroom tile → carpeted room), with brief binaural pans. Structure: A (sparse, dry) → B (more frequent space switches, slightly louder drone) → C (collapse to breath + distant single-note haze). Keep overall restrained, tender, and uncanny.
