# Neon Breathing Room

## Lyrics

Instrumental

## Style

Slow, minimal ambient drone piece. No vocals. No percussion.
Soft, low-frequency harmonic bed with subtle tape hiss and air noise.
Very slow timbral evolution driven by filtering and micro-detuning.
Occasional faint acoustic artifacts (room tone, distant creaks, breath-like noise).
No melody, no clear rhythm, no build—just patient, restrained atmosphere.
Feels intimate, dim, and domestic rather than cinematic or expansive.
