# Torque (for Empty Rooms)

## Lyrics

## Style

Experimental electronic / electroacoustic minimalism.
Focus: restraint, high-resolution texture, “mechanical breath.”

Tempo & structure: ~92 BPM implied (not a steady drumbeat). 3:30–4:30. Slow-build arc with no drop; tension comes from timbral evolution and spatial movement.

Sound palette (foreground):

Close-mic metallic percussion (prepared cymbals, springs, struck steel, muted bell tones)

Clicks/ticks like relay switches, intermittent servo whirs

Microtonal pitched resonances (detuned partials, inharmonic overtones)

Sound palette (background):

Airy noise beds (tape hiss, filtered ventilation, distant sub-rumble)

Occasional short “pressure releases” (tiny bursts of filtered noise)

Harmony: minimal, ambiguous; microtonal/inharmonic clusters that hint at pitch centers but don’t resolve.

Mix/production constraints:

Wide dynamic range; keep transients crisp and intimate.

Use space as composition: short room impulses + occasional long tails, but never lush.

No bright pop shee
