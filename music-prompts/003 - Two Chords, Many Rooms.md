# Two Chords, Many Rooms

## Lyrics

Instrumental

## Style

Experimental ambient/electroacoustic minimalism with a tonal anchor and extreme spatial motion.
Harmony: only two lush chords, slowly alternating (Cmaj(add9) ↔ Abmaj(add9)); keep pitch stable and consonant (no microtonal drift).
Sound sources: bowed-synth strings+organ-like sine stack+faint glass harmonics; airy top end, gentle low-mid warmth, no harshness.
Core concept: the “composition” is space continuous binaural/autopan spirals, mid/side widening, and multiple convolution rooms morphing (tiny closet → stairwell → tiled bathroom → huge hall) with smooth crossfades. Include 2–3 teleport hard-cuts between rooms, but loudness matched and non-jarring.
Micro-events: very soft wood creaks, cloth rubs, distant breath, subtle tape-splice ticks (sparingly).
Constraints: no drums, no risers, no drops, no cinematic trailer swells, no EDM payoff. Restraint over spectacle.
Arc: starts intimate/close-mic roomtone, gradually opens into vast space, ends on unresolved roomtone with the final chord fading out.
