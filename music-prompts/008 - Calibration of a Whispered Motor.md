# Dripline in a Small Dark Room

## Lyrics

[Intro]
(near-field)
hush— hush—
air on teeth

[A]
one… two… three…
(under breath)
one… two… three…
(slightly late)

[B]
don’t move the room
don’t move the room
keep time
keep time

[Bridge]
click— click— click—
(swallows the count)
mm… mm…

[C]
one becomes none
two becomes blur
three becomes thread
(whisper breaks)

[Outro]
hush— hush—
air on teeth

## Style

Minimal electronic, close-mic whisper percussion, mechanical micro-groove, controlled distortion.
Must-haves: tongue clicks + paper snaps as primary pulse (~72 BPM implied), whispered counting as texture (very quiet), dry intimate mix, occasional clipped “servo” whirr bursts, short sections with phase-shifted doubles.
Must-not-haves: NO drum kit, NO EDM risers/drops, NO big chorus payoff, NO chord progression, NO lush pads.
Sound: cold/clinical but bodily; transient-forward; light saturation that thickens only in B and C; pitch mostly ambiguous (no melody lead), brief resonant feedback squeal as a “tone” but not sustained.
Structure: Intro (air) → A (count + click) → B (distortion thickens, phase drift) → Bridge (pulse thins, swallow-silences) → C (densest grit, still steady) → Outro (air returns, count disappears).
