# Thin Wall Metronome

## Lyrics

Instrumental

## Style

Electroacoustic minimal groove / experimental electronic. 92 BPM. No vocals. No standard drum kit (no kick/snare/hi-hat). Percussion is close-miked foley: fingertip taps on glass/wood, paper flicks, zipper ticks, coin clicks, muted palm thuds; edited into tight micro-loops with occasional dropped beats. 4/4 pulse but accents cycle every 5 beats (subtle polymetric tug, not chaotic). Bass is a very soft sine “heartbeat” that never dominates. Harmony: nearly static (single-note overtone pad / faint organ air), no chord progressions, no melody lead. Production: intimate, dry transients up front; occasional short room blooms and narrow-to-wide stereo shifts, but no EDM builds, no risers, no drops. Structure: (1) dry foley pulse establishes, (2) wider room + denser micro-clicks, (3) near-silence with only breathy roomtone + sparse ticks, (4) return with slightly brighter texture, then clean stop. Restrained loudness, lots of negative space.
