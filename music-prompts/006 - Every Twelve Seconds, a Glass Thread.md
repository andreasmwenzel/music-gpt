# Every Twelve Seconds, a Glass Thread

## Lyrics

## Style

Experimental ambient, non-rhythmic clarity, negative space. Close-mic glass chimes + contact-mic taps as the ONLY recurring marker (soft strike every ~12 seconds; sometimes doubled microtonally for beating). Low sine drone + bowed cymbal/metal breath as harmonic bed (no chord changes; no lead melody; gentle overtone bloom). Tape hiss / roomtone as glue; subtle granular “freeze” halos that never swell into pads. Stereo: slow drift + occasional narrow-to-wide focus shifts (no hard teleport cuts). Structure: Intro near-silence → A sparse marker + thin drone → B slightly richer overtone stack, same recurrence → C collapse to hiss + distant harmonics. MUST: restraint, intelligible recurrence, microtonal beating. NO drum kit, NO tempo, NO vocals, NO risers/drops, NO EDM payoff, NO obvious chord progression.
