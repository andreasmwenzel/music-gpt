# Glass Hours at Dawn

## Lyrics

Instrumental

(Designed to let harmony, rhythm, and timbre carry emotional movement without narrative literalism.)

## Style

Warm downtempo electronica with organic accents.
Tempo ~92 BPM.
Soft analog synth pads, muted electric piano, subtle tape hiss, and brushed percussion.
Introduce acoustic guitar harmonics and distant vocal textures used as atmosphere (no clear words).
Mood shifts from reflective night into early-morning clarity—calm, slightly hopeful, unforced.
Avoid heavy drops or dense layering; prioritize groove, breath, and tonal warmth.
Influences: late-night lo-fi, minimal chillwave, cinematic ambient beats.
