# Neon Breathing Room

## Lyrics

I learned the city by its pauses
Red lights humming after rain
Every face a quiet question
Every answer slightly late

I don’t need a bigger feeling
I don’t need a sharper truth
Just a little breathing room
Between what’s leaving and what’s new

Neon breathing room
Windows down at half past two
I’m not lost, I’m just in motion
Letting go in smaller moves

Neon breathing room
Nothing here I have to prove
If I stay inside this moment
It might finally stay too
