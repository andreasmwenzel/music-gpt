# Warm Circuits, Open Windows

## Lyrics

We learned the light by the way it bends
Across the floor at seven ten
Coffee cooling, something said
That neither of us tried to mend

You speak in pauses, I reply
With thoughts I never say out loud
We’re standing still, but time walks by
Like footsteps passing in the crowd

There are rooms we never learned to leave
Doors half closed, dust on the keys
Every word we didn’t say
Still hangs here anyway

The clock keeps time, the plants still grow
The ceiling hums its quiet tone
We live inside what almost was
Like it’s the safest place to run

There are rooms we never learned to leave
We call it calm, but it’s just peace
If I stay and you don’t move
Nothing here will ever bruise

(soft instrumental outro)

## Style

Indie electronic ballad, 105–110 BPM, restrained and intimate.
Soft male or androgynous vocal, close-mic’d, emotionally neutral rather than dramatic.
Minimalist piano motif as harmonic anchor.
Warm analog synth pads, subtle sidechain movement.
Light brushed percussion or muted electronic beat—never dominant.
Modern, cinematic, nocturnal feel.
Mood: reflective, unresolved, quietly human.
Production style similar to The National (electronic-leaning), early James Blake, or low-energy Bon Iver without falsetto.
